## Description of the Service

Astrocartography Calculator allows you to input your birth data (date, time, and location) to generate personalized astrocartography charts and maps. Our service calculates planetary positions using Swiss Ephemeris astronomical data with NASA-grade precision (accurate to 1 mile), analyzing 200,000+ global coordinates to show where planetary energies (Sun, Moon, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and others) are strongest. The system provides interactive astrocartography maps with AI-powered interpretations for relocation planning, career decisions, and personal growth. All birth data calculations occur locally in your browser for maximum privacy. We are an independent astrology service provider.
